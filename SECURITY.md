## Reporting a Vulnerability

As the sole developer maintaining this library, I want to make sure it meets the highest security standards for everyone using it. If you discover or suspect a security vulnerability, your input is of utmost importance. Please follow the procedure outlined below to report your findings:

1. **Reporting Location**: Please email me directly with any suspected vulnerabilities at myemailaddress@domain.com. Please include as much information as possible about the potential security issue, so I can replicate and fully understand it.

2. **Update Frequency**: I endeavor to respond within 48 hours to confirm the receipt of your report. I will then update you on the progress of the investigation and potential fixes at least once a week until the matter is resolved.

3. **Investigation Process**: Once I receive your report, I will dedicate my time to investigate and address it. Your understanding and patience during this process are appreciated as the resolution timeline can vary based on the nature of the reported issue.

4. **If the report is valid**: If the vulnerability you report is valid and previously unknown, I will work swiftly to release a fix. Your contribution will be acknowledged in the notes accompanying the revised library release unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

5. **If the report is not valid**: If your report turns out not to pertain to an actual security vulnerability, I will provide a detailed response explaining why it was declined. Please don't be discouraged, as I appreciate your effort in trying to make this library more secure.

I greatly value your input and active participation in ensuring the security of this library. Your understanding and vigilance form an important part of maintaining high-security standards.
